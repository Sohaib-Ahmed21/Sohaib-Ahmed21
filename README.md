🚀 About me

🎓 I'm a dedicated student pursuing a bachelor's degree in software engineering at National University of Sciences and Technology, and I expect to graduate in 2025.

💻 I first became interested in coding during my freshman year, and I've been committed ever since.

🎨 I am passionate about web development including frontend(**CSS,bootstrap,jQuery**) and backend(**Flask,Django,MERN,Laravel**) and general web design. My true passion is creating visually appealing and user-friendly responsive websites.

💡 I'm expanding my knowledge of design patterns, algorithms, and data structures to improve my talents.

🎮 Outside of programming, I enjoy hanging out with friends.
