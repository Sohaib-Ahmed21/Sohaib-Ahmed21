### 🧠 About Me

🎓 I'm an AI Development Engineer at [VResolv](https://vresolv.io/), graduated in Software Engineering from **NUST (National University of Sciences and Technology)** in **2025**. 

💡 I became passionate about coding in my freshman year and have since grown into an enthusiastic AI/ML engineer.  

🚀 I love working on:
- Deep Learning with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX
- End-to-end ML pipelines
- Real-world problems in Computer Vision, NLP, and Time Series

🧪 I've contributed to some amazing open-source AI libraries:
- 📦 [Keras: Added DeiT (Vision Transformer)](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/pull/2203)
- ⏱ [sktime: Integrated pretrained PyTorch models](https://github.com/sktime/sktime/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASohaib-Ahmed21)
- 🔮 [PyTorch Forecasting: Added TIDE Model](https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASohaib-Ahmed21)
- 📨 [Zulip: Improvements to onboarding and UI flows](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASohaib-Ahmed21)
- ⚡ [PyTorch Lightning: Actively contributing to core features & improvements](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ASohaib-Ahmed21+is%3Aclosed)  


🌱 I'm currently sharpening my skills in system design, optimization, and scalable AI services.  
🎮 Outside of work, I enjoy strategy games and spending time with friends.
